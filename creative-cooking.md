This addon adds 4 new crops, which can be found in Mineshaft or Dungeon loot chests, and they are sold by the wandering trader.
- Lettuce - works like most vanilla crops
- Tomatoes - grows a bush, the top can be harvested when it turns red
- Rice - similar to tomatoes but must be planted in water
- Soybeans - must be harvested quickly if you don't want it to dry out

> Make sure you plant the crops on hydrated farmland, there is currently a Bedrock Edition bug that makes custom crops not work on dry farmland.

Flour can be made from wheat or rice, and makes dough when mixed with water. Dough can be cooked into bread, or crafted into pie crust, pasta, or cookie dough.

The meat slicer is used to turn cooked meat or tofu into meat chunks and sliced meat (for sandwiches).

The cooking pot is a crafting table that is used to craft hot items, like rice, soup, or pasta. It must be placed on top of a furnace, smoker, or campfire.

Soy water can be crafted from soybeans and water, which can be cooked into soy milk or crafted into a tofu mixture. The tofu mixture can be cooked to make tofu, a meat substitute in the meat slicer.
