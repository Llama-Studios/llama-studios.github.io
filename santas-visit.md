First, you will need to wait for Christmas to happen in your Minecraft world. This will happen every once in a while, and will be announced in chat. You can also activate Christmas manually using the Totem of Santa item, only obtainable from presents.

Next, craft a Christmas tree. The recipe should be in the recipe book. Place it down within 30 blocks of your bed, and make sure there is space around it for Santa to leave the presents.

Then, write your Christmas list. Craft some blank Christmas List Paper using a paper and green dye, and then combine it with one of the following items to request it:

- Redstone Dust - Redstone Components
- Cobblestone - Stone Blocks
- Sapling - Wood
- Bone - Mobs
- Book - Enchanted Book
- Bread - Food
- Wooden Sword - Tools and Armor
- Coal - Minerals

Hold the Christmas list and interact (right click) to send it.

Then, wait for night time, and then sleep. In the morning, there will be four presents under the tree. Two will be the type you requested, and two will be of a random type. Break the presents and enjoy your gifts!
