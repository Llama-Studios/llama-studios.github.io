## What is dowsing?
Dowsing is a psuedoscience (fake science) where people would carry around a stick (known as a dowsing rod), and if the stick moved in a certain way, it was believed that there was something important underground. This was traditionally used to find water for wells, but later to find caves, minerals, and oil deposits. Studies have shown that dowsing is no more accurate than random chance, but this addon brings actually useful dowsing to Minecraft.

## The Rods
There are 8 different types of dowsing rods that find different things:
- Oak - finds water
- Birch - finds ores
- Spruce - finds caves
- Jungle - finds underground structures
- Acacia - finds cave biomes
- Dark Oak - finds geodes
- Crimson - finds lava
- Warped - finds nether ores

## Usage
To use a dowsing rod, hold it and interact (right-click). The results will appear in the chat:

Since dowsing rods search in a + shape, digging straight down (while dangerous) will give you access to everything your rod found.

## Crafting
The basic rods are crafted from 4 logs and one enchanted stick:

|   |   | L |
|---|---|---|
|   | L | / |
| L |   | L |

L = log

/ = enchanted stick

Enchanted sticks are either dropped by witches, or made from enchantable sticks. Enchantable sticks are crafted like this:
|   | L |   |
|---|---|---|
| L | / | L |
|   | L |   |

L = lapis lazuli

/ = stick

Hold the enchantable stick and interact (right-click) to make an enchanted stick. This also costs 4 levels.

### Upgrading
All of the dowsing rods can be upgraded to get more durability, more range, and a shorter cooldown. The following recipe is used to upgrade dowsing rods:

| A |   | A |
|---|---|---|
| G | I | / |
| A |   | A |

A = amethyst shard

G = gold block

I = iron block

/ = the dowsing rod you want to upgrade
