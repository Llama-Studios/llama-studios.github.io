## Experience
Experience can be obtained from Living Bookshelves, a new craftable block. Interact (right-click) on a Living Bookshelf for a chance to gain experience, which the bookshelf will regenerate over time. The more you use the Living Bookshelf, the more experience it will give.

Living Bookshelves cannot be used to power enchanting tables.

## Gunpowder
Gunpowder can be crafted from Sulfur, a new ore found in the Nether. Sulfur can also be used to make yellow dye, and as a fuel half as good as coal.

## Blaze Rods and Powder
Blaze Rods and Powder can be obtained from the Blaze Blossom, a new flower found in the Nether. The Blaze Blossom will occasionally drop either a Blaze Rod or Blaze Powder on the ground near it.

## Spider Eyes
Spider Eyes have a 50% chance of being sold by Cleric villagers on their second tier.

## Dragon's Breath, Nether Star, Phantom Membrane, Totems
All of these items can be crafted, check the recipe book.

## Dragon Egg
The Dragon Egg can be crafted by combining several difficult to obtain items. You can think of this as the goal to peaceful mode, as the Ender Dragon cannot be fought.

## Ghast Tears
Ghast tears can be bartered from Piglins. Remember that Piglins can also give you Ender Pearls.

## Music Discs
All music discs (except otherside and Pigstep) can now be found in loot chests.

## Mob Heads
Skeleton, Creeper, and Zombie Heads can be rarely found in dungeon, mineshaft, stronghold, and igloo chests. Wither Skeleton Skulls can be crafted from Skeleton Skulls and Wither Roses.

## Tridents and Prismarine
Tridents and Prismarine Crystals and Shards can be found in underwater ruin chests. You can also de-craft Prismarine and Sea Lanterns into their ingredients. Remember that these blocks can also be taken from ocean monuments.

## Slimeballs, Bones, and Rotten Flesh
Slimeballs, Bones, and Rotten Flesh can now be dropped by most passive mobs. Also remember that Slime + Blaze Powder = Magma Cream, and that you can get Bone Meal from composting.
