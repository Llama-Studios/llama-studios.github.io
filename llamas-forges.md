**Make sure you enable all experimental features before playing!**

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to mine [zinc](/zinc), a new ore, and also grab some terracotta, either from a mesa biome or by smelting clay blocks. You can then craft a [melting basin](/melting-basin), which is used to melt ores, and is fuelled using lava. See the [melting basin](/melting-basin) page for instructions.

You'll also need a [casting basin](/casting-basin), which is used for making molds and parts. See its page for instructions.

Once you've made all the parts, you'll need to combine them in an [assembly table](/assembly-table).
