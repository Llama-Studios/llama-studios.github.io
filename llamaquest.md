  A few recipes have been tweaked or removed in this addon to make it a little more difficult, I thought some of the recipes were too over powered. I also changed the void miner to be able to mine modded ores.

  I removed a few of the structures as I didn't like them and they made the file size of the modpack quite big.

## The Questbook
![Questbook Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31634240/115973831-f81daf00-a525-11eb-8449-9c6339a91e35.jpg)

LlamaQuest is a quest-based modpack, so you'll spend a lot of time in this modpack working on quests. You will get the questbook in the bonus chest (you remembered to turn that on, didn't you?), but you can also craft one if you need to. To read the questbook, simply interact (right-click) while holding (do the same thing you would do to eat or throw an ender pearl). This will give you four new questbooks, for each of the quest branches. There are four branches, exploration, automation, magic, and cooking, with 25 quests each. Once you finish a branch, you can get a trophy to celebrate. Finish all the branches and you can get a special completionist trophy. To submit a quest, combine the questbook with the items required in the crafting table.

The LlamaQuest thumbnail, built out of the new blocks from Stratospheer's Paint Addon, which makes planks, stone, cobblestone, bricks, and more dyeable. In the background you can see an abandoned castle from More Simple Structures, as well as trees from Better Trees.

On the left are the melting basin, casting basin, assembly table, template table, and zinc ore, all from Llama's Forges. On the right is some amber ore as well as a Soul Infuser from Soul Magic.

In the chat, you can see an example of how the questbook works. There is also the power core, water wheel, and some solar generators from Advanced Machinery. In the background you can see some trees from Better Trees.
