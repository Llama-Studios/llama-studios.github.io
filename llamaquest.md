  A few recipes have been tweaked or removed in this addon to make it a little more difficult, I thought some of the recipes were too over powered. I also changed the void miner to be able to mine modded ores.

  A few recipes have been tweaked, I also removed some of the structures as I thought they were too common.

  I removed a few of the structures as I didn't like them and they made the file size of the modpack quite big.
