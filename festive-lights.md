The lights can be placed on the side of any block, similar to glow lichen.

The lights can also hang.

To place hanging lights, place the lights while looking up. Once you have one placed this way, other lights placed next to it will also be hanging.

## Crafting
All of the lights except for the rainbow one are crafted like this:
|   | S |   |
|---|---|---|
|   | D |   |
|   | G |   |

S = string

D = glowstone dust

G = glass, use stained glass for colored ones


The rainbow lights are crafted like this:

| R | O | Y |
|---|---|---|
| L | G | C |
| A | B | P |

R = red string light

O = orange string light

Y = yellow string light

L = lime string light

G = green string light

C = cyan string light

A = light blue string light

B = blue string light

P = purple string light
