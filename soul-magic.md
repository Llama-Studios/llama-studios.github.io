## Soul Silver
Soul Silver is a new ore found throughout the nether. It is the first step in making the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser). You will need a total of 27 Soul Silver ingots in order to make the Soul Infuser, but you will want a bit more for other recipes.

## Wither Meal
Wither Meal is a somewhat-rare drop from Wither Skeletons, and nine of them can also be crafted from a Wither Skeleton Skull. It is used to make Spawners, [Soul Meal](#soul-meal), and tapping/right-clicking on the ground with it will turn all living things nearby into withered variants:

- Podzol -> Soul Sand
- Mycelium -> Soul Soil
- Grass -> Wither Grass
- Nylium -> Wither Nylium
- Logs/Stems -> Wither Stem
- Leaves/Wart Blocks/Mushroom Blocks -> Withered Wart Block
- Shroomlight/Pumpkin/Melon/Cocoa Beans -> Witherlight
- Tall Grass/Cactus/Sugarcane -> Withered Tall Grass
- Flowers/Nether Fungus -> Wither Rose

Wither Meal can also be crafted into four [Wither Dust](#wither-dust).

## Soul Sparks
Soul Sparks are an item used in the creation of spawn eggs. They are a rare drop from most hostile mobs, and a common drop from [Souls](#souls) and [Missmatched Souls](#missmatched-souls).

They also have a smaller version known as the Soul Scrap. It is a common drop from [Souls](#souls) and [Missmatched Souls](#missmatched-souls), and four of them can be crafted into one Soul Spark.

## Soul Infuser
The Soul Infuser is a multiblock structure that is used to make spawn eggs and some other things. It is made up of two main parts. The Soul Infuser Core is the center of the Soul Infuser. It is crafted like this:

| N | I | N |
|---|---|---|
| I | B | I |
| I | I | I |

N = [soul silver nugget](#soul-silver)

I = [soul silver ingot](#soul-silver)

B = gold block

When you place it down, four Pedestal Ghost blocks will appear. To complete the Soul Infuser, you will need to place a Pedestal in each of them. Pedestals are crafted like this:

| N | I | N |
|---|---|---|
|   | I |   |
| I | I | I |

N = [soul silver nugget](#soul-silver)

I = [soul silver ingot](#soul-silver)


### Using the Soul Infuser
Most Soul Infuser recipes will require four [Soul Sparks](#soul-sparks). To provide Soul Sparks to the Soul Infuser, place one in each of the pedestals.

There are five recipes that are done in the Soul Infuser:
- Glass Bottle + [Soul Silver Ingot](#soul-silver) = [Empty Soul Jar](#soul-jar) - This recipe does not require Soul Sparks
- Soul Sand + [Wither Meal](#wither-meal) = [Soul Meal](#soul-meal)
- [Amber](#amber)/[Mandrake](#mandrakes) + Matching [Soul Jar](#soul-jar) = Random Spawn Egg + [Empty Soul Jar](#soul-jar)
- [Amber](#amber)/[Mandrake](#mandrakes) + Non-Matching [Soul Jar](#soul-jar) = [Missmatched Soul](#missmatched-souls)
- Iron Ingot + Coal = [Soul Steel Ingot](#soul-steel)

## Wither Dust
Wither Dust is a common drop from Wither Skeletons, and is almost always dropped from Withered Tall Grass. It can be crafted into Black Dye.

## Soul Meal
Soul Meal is an item used in the crafting process for Spawners.
