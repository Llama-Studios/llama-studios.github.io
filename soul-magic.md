## Soul Silver
Soul Silver is a new ore found throughout the nether. It is the first step in making the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser). You will need a total of 27 Soul Silver ingots in order to make the Soul Infuser, but you will want a bit more for other recipes.

Soul Silver is also used to make the [Spawner Smasher](#spawner-smasher).

## Wither Meal
Wither Meal is a somewhat-rare drop from Wither Skeletons, and nine of them can also be crafted from a Wither Skeleton Skull. It is used to make Spawners, [Soul Meal](#soul-meal), and tapping/right-clicking on the ground with it will turn all living things nearby into withered variants:

- Podzol -> Soul Sand
- Mycelium -> Soul Soil
- Grass -> Wither Grass
- Nylium -> Wither Nylium
- Logs/Stems -> Wither Stem
- Leaves/Wart Blocks/Mushroom Blocks/Moss Block -> Withered Wart Block
- Shroomlight/Pumpkin/Melon/Cocoa Beans/Spore Blossom -> Witherlight
- Tall Grass/Cactus/Sugarcane/Bamboo/Cave Vines/Dripleaves/Azaleas -> Withered Tall Grass
- Flowers/Nether Fungus -> Wither Rose

Wither Meal can also be crafted into four [Wither Dust](#wither-dust).

## Soul Sparks
Soul Sparks are an item used in the creation of spawn eggs. They are a rare drop from most hostile mobs, and a common drop from [Souls](#souls) and [Missmatched Souls](#missmatched-souls).

Soul Sparks can be placed the Pedestals of the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser), and are needed to power it for most recipes.

They also have a smaller version known as the Soul Scrap. It is a common drop from [Souls](#souls) and [Missmatched Souls](#missmatched-souls), and four of them can be crafted into one Soul Spark.

## Soul Infuser
![IMG_1602](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31634240/114616272-a72fd000-9c74-11eb-9085-f7b2250f0914.jpg)

The Soul Infuser is a multiblock structure that is used to make spawn eggs and some other things. It is made up of two main parts. The Soul Infuser Core is the center of the Soul Infuser. It is crafted like this:

| N | I | N |
|---|---|---|
| I | B | I |
| I | I | I |

N = [soul silver nugget](#soul-silver)

I = [soul silver ingot](#soul-silver)

B = gold block

When you place it down, four Pedestal Ghost blocks will appear. To complete the Soul Infuser, you will need to place a Pedestal in each of them. Pedestals are crafted like this:

| N | I | N |
|---|---|---|
|   | I |   |
| I | I | I |

N = [soul silver nugget](#soul-silver)

I = [soul silver ingot](#soul-silver)


### Using the Soul Infuser
Most Soul Infuser recipes will require four [Soul Sparks](#soul-sparks). To provide Soul Sparks to the Soul Infuser, place one in each of the pedestals.

There are five recipes that are done in the Soul Infuser:
- Glass Bottle + [Soul Silver Ingot](#soul-silver) = [Empty Soul Jar](#soul-jar) - This recipe does not require Soul Sparks
- Soul Sand + [Wither Meal](#wither-meal) = [Soul Meal](#soul-meal)
- [Amber/Mandrake](#amber-and-mandrakes) + Matching [Soul Jar](#soul-jar) = Random Spawn Egg + [Empty Soul Jar](#soul-jar)
- [Amber/Mandrake](#amber-and-mandrakes) + Non-Matching [Soul Jar](#soul-jar) = [Missmatched Soul](#missmatched-souls)
- Iron Ingot + Coal = [Soul Steel Ingot](#soul-steel)

## Wither Dust
Wither Dust is a common drop from Wither Skeletons, and is almost always dropped from Withered Tall Grass. It can be crafted into Black Dye.

## Soul Meal
Soul Meal is an item used in the crafting process for Spawners.

## Soul Jar
Soul Jars are items used for capturing [Souls](#souls). To capture a Soul, interact (right click) on it while holding an empty Soul Jar. There are actually 4 different types of Soul Jars, which depend on the type of Soul they contain, although they look identical. The only way to check the type of Soul inside is by releasing it by tapping or right-clicking on the ground using a filled Soul Jar.

Soul Jars are made in the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser) from a Glass Bottle and a [Soul Silver Ingot](#soul-silver). This is the only Soul Infuser recipe that does not require [Soul Sparks](#soul-sparks).

## Amber and Mandrakes
Amber is an ore found underground in the overworld. When mined, it can drop any one of 4 different types of amber. Each type corresponds to a different type of [Soul](#souls). Amber is used in the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser) to make spawn eggs.

Mandrakes are an alternative to Amber that can be grown. You can find their seeds exclusively in loot chests, or you can craft them if you have all 4 types of mandrakes. Like Amber, Mandrakes have 4 variants that correspond to different types of [Souls](#souls), and they can be used in place of Amber in recipes.

## Soul Steel
Soul Steel is a new metal alloy. It is created from an Iron Ingot and a piece of Coal in the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser) with all 4 [Soul Sparks](#soul-sparks) in place.

Soul Steel's only use is for creating mob spawners using this recipe:


| I | S | I |
|---|---|---|
| S | W | S |
| I | S | I |

I = soul steel ingot

S = [soul meal](#soul-meal)

W = [wither meal](#wither-meal)


Soul Steel is also dropped from Smashed Spawners, which are made using the [Spawner Smasher](#spawner-smasher).

## Soul Meal
Soul Meal is an item used in the crafting of spawners. It is made in the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser) from [Wither Meal](#wither-meal) and Soul Sand with all 4 [Soul Sparks](#soul-sparks) in place.

When placed on the ground, Soul Meal will spawn a random mob (excluding bosses).

## Missmatched Souls
![IMG_1601](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31634240/114616004-59b36300-9c74-11eb-80b4-5f988c56bc9e.jpg)

The Missmatched Soul is a mini-boss mob that spawns when you don't correctly match a [Soul Jar](#soul-jar) with an [Amber or Mandrake](#amber-and-mandrakes) in the [Soul Infuser](#soul-infuser).

Missmatched Souls look like completely blue Zombies. Their health, size, speed, knockback resistance, and attack damage is randomized. If they have extreme health or attack damage, they will have a boss bar. They also have a chance of having random beneficial (to them) effects, such as fire resistance, fall damage resistance, or an area of effect of damage, poison, weakness, or slowness.

Missmatched Souls drop [Soul Sparks and Soul Scraps](#soul-sparks), as well as normal Zombie drops and XP.

## Souls
![IMG_1603](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31634240/114616314-b0b93800-9c74-11eb-87ae-c1449ae4c05d.PNG)

Souls are tiny blue flying mobs found in Soul Sand Valleys in the Nether. They have 15 health (7.5 hearts) and do 4 (2 hearts) of damage. They move by flying, similar to Bees but a bit faster. Upon death, they drop [Soul Sparks and Soul Scraps](#soul-sparks), as well as some XP.

Souls can be captured in [Soul Jars](#soul-jar) by interacting (right clicking) on them while holding an empty Soul Jar.

Souls have 4 different variants which look slightly different. When you capture them in a Soul Jar, the variant is saved inside the jar, although you can't see it, so make sure you remember which type you caught. You can release them from the jar if you forget, but then they will be able to fight you.

## Spawner Smasher
The Spawner Smasher is a tool used to smash spawners. To do this, right-click or hold down your finger. This will convert any mob spawner within a 15 block radius into a Smashed Spawner, which no longer spawns mobs, and instead can be broken to get some [Soul Steel](#soul-steel). It also will use up 1 of the Spawner Smasher's 25 durability.

The Spawner Smasher is crafted like this:

| I | B | I |
|---|---|---|
|   | S |   |
|   | S |   |

I = [soul silver ingot](#soul-silver)

B = [soul silver block](#soul-silver)

S = stick
